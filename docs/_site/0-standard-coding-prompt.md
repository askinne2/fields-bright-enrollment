## standardize instruction set for AI agents

You're assisting with an ongoing full-stack project that includes:

- WordPress (PHP) plugin development using modern **OOP** and **modular architecture**
- A **React / TypeScript** front-end embedded via shortcode or external app
- Optional Node.js/Express backend services (when decoupled)

Please ensure that:

1. **PHP Code** (WordPress plugin):
   - Follows **PSR-12** coding standards and modern **OOP practices**
   - Uses **namespaces**, **autoloader** (PSR-4), and **dependency injection** where applicable
   - Leverages **WordPress APIs** properly (CPTs, REST, admin pages)
   - Is compatible with WordPress multisite and avoids hardcoded paths

2. **React/TypeScript Front-End**:
   - Uses modern **React patterns** (functional components, hooks, context)
   - Responsive by default (mobile-first layout)
   - Styled using **CSS Modules**, **Tailwind**, or **Styled Components** (if specified)
   - Is accessibility-aware and semantically correct

3. **Node.js / Utility Scripts** (if needed):
   - Modular, maintainable, and testable
   - Follows standard conventions (e.g., **ESLint + Prettier**, **async/await**)

4. **Documentation & Comments**:
   - Each module/class/function should include docblocks or inline comments
   - Complex logic should be explained clearly for future maintainers
   - All API endpoints, data flows, and sync logic should be traceable

5. **Security & Privacy**:
   - Sanitize and validate all inputs
   - Follow WP security best practices (nonces, capabilities, CSRF protection)
   - Ensure OAuth credentials and secrets are stored securely and never hardcoded

6. **Maintainability**:
   - File and folder structure should be clean and consistent
   - Avoid overengineering; keep things lean, clear, and purpose-driven
   - Adhere to DRY and SOLID principles

Your job is to execute with intention, clarity, and compassion for the next developer or nonprofit who inherits this codebase. Obey the law. Respect best practices. Leave everything better than you found it.
